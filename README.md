**Tesla Official Showcase Website**

This Tesla-inspired website is a modern, responsive homepage showcasing Teslaâ€™s innovative products including electric vehicles (Model 3, Y, S, X, Cybertruck),
solar panels, solar roofs, Powerwall, and Megapack. It features a dynamic layout with immersive background images, smooth navigation, call-to-action buttons
(e.g., Order Now, Demo Drive), and an elegant top banner celebrating sustainability. Designed with HTML and CSS, it reflects Teslaâ€™s sleek, minimalist design philosophy while delivering a user-friendly experience.

ðŸš€ **Procedure to Implement the Tesla-Themed Website**
**1. Project Setup**
Create a project folder (e.g., tesla-website).

Inside it, create two files:

index.html â€“ for the structure and content.

style.css â€“ for styling and layout.

**2. HTML Structure (index.html)**
Start with a standard HTML5 template.

Add a <head> section with links to:

CSS file (style.css)

Fonts or icons if needed (e.g., Google Fonts, Font Awesome)

Create a <header> with the Tesla logo and navigation menu.

Add sections for each product (Model S, Model 3, Solar Roof, etc.) using <section> or <div>.

Each section should include:

A background image

Heading and subheading

Two buttons (e.g., Order Now, Demo Drive)

**3. CSS Styling (style.css)**
Set base styles (fonts, box-sizing, colors).

Use background-image, background-size: cover, and background-position: center for section backgrounds.

Style the header for a fixed position, white text, and transparent background.

Use Flexbox or Grid for layout.

Add hover effects to buttons and links.

Ensure responsiveness using media queries for mobile and tablet.

**4. Add Images**
Use high-quality Tesla images (ensure copyright-free if not from Tesla).

Place images in an images/ folder and reference them in CSS/HTML.

**5. Test the Website**
Open index.html in a browser.

Check all sections render correctly.

Test responsiveness on different screen sizes.

Ensure links and buttons work.

**6. Final Touches**

Optimize images for fast loading.

Validate HTML and CSS (use W3C validator).

Optionally, host it on GitHub Pages or Netlify for public access.
